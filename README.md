Online video annotator app (in progress).  
Functional progress on this app has been stalled by issues with the interval tree implementation it uses.  Sadly, this seems to currently be the only good JavaScript implementation of an interval tree data structure!  At some point I will probably get a CoffeeScript environment set up to work on the itree library, and then I may resume work on the annotator.  
HOWEVER, save for issues with actually retrieving the annotations during playback sometimes, the app currently mostly works and is entirely client-side.
